We're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you.
I call it painting the wall.
"So we're going to go up and down; let's switch hands, down and up; down and up."
And just let those fingers relax.
Now together you're going to go opposite.
Do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable.
"It's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead, so try not to let them do that."
Let the wrist do all the leading.
"So this one what you're going to start with, let's take one hand first; it's going to, the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up."
"So basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement, and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going."
"Don't let the fingers take over, let the wrist do all the guiding."
Let's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft.
"Our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted, and our arms are relaxed; are shoulders are nice and relaxed."
So let's start with the one hand going up and down.
We're going to keep this right in front of us; you don't want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself.
You want it right in front of your solar plexus.
In this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise.
"The number one loss for these birds, is flight."
You need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted.
It seems to be the number one way to loose them.
"Once they get loose outside, predators will get to them very quickly."
"These guys are not suited to live in the United States, they are not native here and they don't survive."
"The other dangers you need to worry about, is Teflon pans."
"If they are heated to a high temperature, they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead."
There is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly.
It is kind of a silent killer.
"So, if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with Teflon, move them to another room in the house, so that you can protect them."
"Aerosols, spraying for bugs, spraying perfumes around the house, all those sort of things, these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs."
"If these guys are flighted, you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household."
"And, these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die."
So you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house.
"And lastly, they are so so tiny, basically anything in your house, a dog, a cat, anything, they can get squished in a door, if they get mouthed, even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat, or by your kid, they will just squished."
"There is not a whole lot to them, they are not that robust, they are mostly feathers."
You have to be fairly careful with these birds.
At least in a physical way.
Those are most of your household dangers.
"And again, if you are cooking and the birds are loose, be careful with them landing on a hot pan."
You don't want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned.
"Just be careful, you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage, you basically bombproof your house."
A lot of these birds aren't tame.
You make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for.
"And, if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage, they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can't reach through the bars."
Like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird.
"And, if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine, raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys."
So you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time.
"That more or less covers it, just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are."
People get them and they only have two or three of them.
As you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away.
"And when they panic, they fly and they don't come back."
They fly out your windows.
They fly out your front door.
"You will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter, son, husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out."
"I hope this becomes very popular, here of late, is the circle hooks. Now, circle hooks has been used by Japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years, but in recent years, they've developed lighter, smaller, in shore type hooks, which are very well suited, particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing."
"This hook, basically is designed, to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth."
"Now this type of hook, when you get a bite, you can't jerk the rod to set the hook."
"You basically just reel down, and get the line tight, and the fish will take off, and when he does, he usually turns, and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth, and it sort of acts, really like a, kind of like a bottle opener."
"Once you get it in there, it is very difficult to remove this hook, so if you catch a lot of fish, when you hook up the fish, you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism."
"The nice thing about the circle hook is, you don't gut hook a lot of fish."
You don't damage a lot of fish.
You simply get him up to the boat.
"If you want to release him, you can release him, or cut the hook out, and it's a pretty, it's a pretty friendly hook, for fishing."
MICHAEL ROSENGART: Thrusters.
"Right now, we're going to get into a more complicated exercise."
Jonesy is going to sit back.
"And as he drives up, again, driving on his heel, driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up."
Good.
And then there's a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders.
"Not out to the side, not back, but right above."
That's good.
"Good work, Jonesy."
"Again working from the heels up, work with your breath; feel that you're driving your hips forward and up each time, good work."
"Do ten of those and we're going to take a three to five minute break, and then come back to it."
"Again, I want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing the thruster that it's working from the ground up, and it is one smooth movement."
We're integrating more of the body.
It's not segmented.
"It's not the squat and a shoulder press, okay?"
It's one smooth movement.
Try it.
And we're going to develop more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion.
Okay.
"So, Jonesy, you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is?"
"Jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells, bring it up to his shoulders."
"And we're, basically, he's going to sit back into a squat."
"And we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press, but it's not that simple."
It's not segmented like that.
Another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end.

"So no matter what the length of your hair, long as it's long enough to add a, at the hair on, we can start by braiding it on, then braid, then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like, whatever size you like, whatever color you like."

"Whatever length, we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on."

"We're going to look at it from several aspects and the first thing that I would want to speak to would be the owner of the business, the CEO and in my profession, and I work for a company that provides wellness programs."
We've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results.
Another one would be eating a proper diet.
"And you know when we got to that, I said, you know it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the bad foods."
"And I said, you know like ice cream, ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time, it's got so much sugar in it it's really going have an effect, and the president said whoa, you can't go there, that's my favorite food."
"And so then I said well, maybe soda would be something that you would start with as."
"And he said whoa wait, the vice president said we can't go there because you know because he's addicted to soda."
And so the net after our presentation I called back and I wasn't getting any callbacks.
We want a wellness program but we really don't want to lead.
"But when you think about that, is that going to get the job done for you."
"So I speak to you Mr. CEO, Mr. corporate owner, Mr. corporate president, you that are trying to produce something positive in your company, you need to pay attention to your own health."
"Think about it, if you have a heart attack, if you are hit with cancer, what is that going to do to your organization?"
"And so the real key to it is you Mr. CEO, you Mr. owner of the business and why would that be."
"Well if you are not healthy, can you have a healthy organization?"
"If you are not setting the example, if you are not being the leader then who's going to lead."
"I've spoken with several different companies and I can remember one particular bank president in his senior vice president, we sat down together and we started to talk about the subject of, because he wanted a wellness program, that's why I was there."
"And so we started talking about it and I said to him, well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees."
And I said well one of them would be exercise.
You are going to have to have someway of getting your employees involved with regular exercise.
"Another one is drinking water, we're going to get into these in a little more detail."
Let's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that.
"Again, so many variations."
"The key on this one, and something to keep in mind on this position, is this."
"If you're tubing is really tight, you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together."
"A squat position, close together, doesn't work very well."
"So the key on something like this, is that your tubing, what you've purchased, or what you have, has enough flexibility, that when you stand on it, you can really stand wide."
"But it's definitely a great exercise, and I highly recommend it."
I'm going to show you something simple and basic.
"I've got my feet about shoulder width apart, pretty much have to, to do a descent squat."
"I'm going to take my tubing up, and I'm going to open up my palms so they're facing forward."
What am I doing with this?
"As I go down and up in a squat position, I have to resist the tubing, right?"
It's trying to keep me from coming up.
"As I stretch the tubing straight up and down, it makes the squat harder."
"Once again, you don't want to bend forward too much on this."
To begin your dotted nail art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as a dotter.
A stylus comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large.
There's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do.
"For a very small intricate design like an ""i"" you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have where as if you're wanting to do something large such as the sun you're going to want to use the largest end that you have."
There's also sizes if you wanted to do things like buttons or just small designs like that.
For your polish color you're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting.
I prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen.
"Hello, my names Rebecca Herrick, I'm a licensed massage therapist in Wilmington, North Carolina and I'm here to give my review on Massage Parlors."
"First of all Massage Parlor is a very dated term and often has some negative connotations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to kind of steer away from that and, you know, work, hard to get the respect that the therapeutic aspect of massage therapy deserves."
"So, having said that, when you're looking for a place to have a massage you can call it a massage therapy center, or a wellness center, something of that nature, and when you're doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing there."
You always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapist.
"You can check with local networks, newspapers, other massage therapists in the area, for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on massage parlor reviews."
"Now, lets not forget your charity or event website."
This is a great place to promote your sponsors as well.
"You can do this through banners, links to their website, or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor."
"Finally, I hope you're going to hand out lots and lots of flyers."
A flyer is a great way to promote the sponsor.
"Again, depending on the level, they might just get their website listed."
"If it's a large sponsor, they can have their logo or their full ad."
The more colorful and bright the flyer the better.
"Remember sponsors are looking for potential customers, promotion, and publicity."
Also remember a happy sponsor is sure to come back year after year after year.
How can I create great sponsorships for my golf tournament you cry?
"Well, no worries because that's exactly what this segment is about."
Let's take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors.
"To begin with, you can utilize your very own golf program that you're going to be printing."
"Now, depending on the size of the sponsorship, you can offer quarter page, half page, or full-page ads."
Title sponsors might get advertisement on the front the back cover of the actual program.
Another great perk; offer a vendor table at the event.
Companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event.
"ELIZABETH ROSE: The next thing we're going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the tension, where your headache is happening."
"So, I'm going to put my hair back, so that you guys can see it, it's a little bit easier."
"Again, when you're here, the shoulders aren't creeping up."
They're still melting down on either side of the spine.
"You're going to inhale, think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades, and exhale."
"Stick with your 3-part breath into the belly, into the ribcage, and then into the heart."
"Then as you inhale, you're going to let the left ear come over toward the left shoulder."
"Notice again, the right shoulder isn't going to pop up and the left shoulder isn't going to come up to support the ear in your chest."
Just keep then gently falling down.
"So inhale and lift your ear up, and you're going to breathe here."
"Now, slowly begin to connect these movements, exhaling as you drop the chin toward the chest and inhaling as the ear rolls up towards the shoulder blades, and do this as long as you're comfortable."
I'd say at least 20 repetitions.
"All that's going to happen is you're going to be seated in your easy seated pose, again, with your sits bone on the floor or on a block."
"If you can keep it going for a minute, that's great, but stick with the breath."
Let the breath be the emphasis for every movement and don't ever let yourself give the breath away.
"You're going to inhale and the crown of the head reaches up so that you're sitting tall, but you're not going to be propped this way."
"If you're sitting this way, then just relax so that your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine, but the crown of your head is still reaching up."
"You're going to inhale, and then as you exhale, just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder."
"Notice how my shoulders don't creep up--[SOUNDS LIKE] errk--as I drop the ear down, right?"
"They're going to stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine, and I'm exhaling to just drop my right ear toward the right shoulder."
"Take a couple breaths here, inhaling and exhaling, and then, in and out through the nose, remember."
"And then on an exhale, you're going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest."
Now I've been applying product to both eyes and I'm finishing out the top of the left side of her eye.
"Open, relax and open those eyes."
"Then I look for even and these are beautifully, evenly done."
"Then what I would do is get ice packs out and, before I even start the bottoms, just to relieve any kind of swelling and for comfort, I would ice pack her eyes and let her relax and take five minutes while I set up for the step two to the bottom eyes."
In this section we are going to talk about full body movement.
So you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country runner.
So what I mean by full body movement is from your upper body down to your lower body.
"Your upper body you do not want to be timid or shy, I know it is going to feel a little silly if you do not really move your arms, but you should really be moving your arms."
"And the reason you will see is that arm movement a lot, especially when the intensity increases, and let's say you come to that hill, you really want to make sure you move your arms because you are now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body, and you are getting more oxygen into your lungs, and you are breathing in that fresh air, and blowing it back out with full body movement."
"Now as far as your lower body, your legs, you want to make sure that you put most of the weight down your calves."
"So you see if I was running, as I am running I am putting most of the weight on my calves and I am moving my body and I am moving my arms and my shoulders."
And breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth.
"And will you notice the difference the next time you run, just remember in your mind what I said."
"The more that you move your arms, you are going to see yourself increasing in speed and you are going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there which does very little movement."
We are talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shape face.
You want to reduce the width at the sides so you want to go with a bob something short.
Probably a little bit shorter then this but something like this would be good.
Diamond shape faces need a narrow side and at the chin so if it came down to the chin that would be really good it would complete your look.
Avoid wearing height on top or volume on the sides.
You can use a bang to cover a narrow forehead or something like this would be really great right about here like this really helps change the shape of the face and give you a better look throughout.
REBECCA SATO: Hi.
"So what they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of embodies that character, someone who realizes that they know but that they don't know too well."
"And what they do is every time they're writing from that character's perspective or about that character, they will think what would that person that I know do, how would they react, how would they sound, how would they look and kind of look at that from that perspective."
"And what's nice is that it's not someone that you know super well and so there's still a lot of room for imagination and creative interpretation which, I think, is very important and we should let it do that."
"So basically, you have this really great base where you know the person enough that you have something to start with but you don't know him so well that it takes away their wonder."
"So try that with your characters and that should really give you something to start with, a really great framework."
And we're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about.
"And it doesn't matter if they love them or they hate them or they love to hate them, preferably a little of everything."
"Not necessarily with the same character, that will be a little conflicted, but with a range of characters that people are having this emotional experience and are able to identify with these people as they read."
"And right now, I'm talking primarily about stories whether it's short stories or novels, but this actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting and advertising and if you're writing a storyboard for a commercial."
"I mean, you still want to know how to develop good characters."
"But primarily, I'll be talking about it from the standpoint of traditional story."
So one thing that I find to be very helpful and that a lot of really great writers have mentioned--and these are writers who are rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them--is to develop a really great character.
It helps to have a little bit of information but not too much information.
Now you put the eggs in before you put your flour mixture in.
"Now this is, you just don't put the whole thing in there you have to gradually put your flour in there."
Let me repeat you do not want to just throw it in your flour all at once.
Just gradually do it.
Maybe a couple of cups at a time.
"Like I said, if you still have a little Crisco and it is floating around it is okay."
At this time I'm going to add my flour and it takes 6 cups so you need to get.
It is great if you have one of these really big measuring cups.
Let me see.
Let's get the glasses.
"Let me see if I have, I only have 4 in there."
Let me add some more.
Okay I have my 6 cups.
"JASON PAINTER: Hi, I'm Jason."
"Today, we're painting on glass."
"Fill that in, just like that."
We don't have to do anything anymore.
We'll be defeating the purpose.
"We'll just spread that paint out thinner and thinner, and just be frustrated in the end."
"So, this line here is not touching."
"We can just put a little dab of black there, same as up here."
"Just, basically, just want everything to touch and that's going to make a big difference when we fill in with the white."
"So, go ahead and fill in everywhere that you gotta fill in, and look at it, and we'll wait for that to dry."
And touch up the white.
"We have put the first coat, the liner, and the fill in on all three of the steps."
It's looking like it's ready now to be--we can really start touching up the liner.
We can really start touching up the black.
"If we look at it, we can see spots that-that filled in and spots that didn't, and we don't have to worry about how these thick line--it really looks bad right now, but we're just in the beginning stages."
"So, really, those we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect, everywhere that we know they're going to need to, and all of the lines are filled in that we know we're going to need to."
"So, we just take the angle brush back again, get black back out, and really, the less paint you have on here, the better, just a very little on the tip of your brush."
"This line right here needs to be filled in, and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes."
We're just going to set the paint right on it.
"Hi, my name is Dave Andrews."
"Today, I'm going to show you how to run a macro in Excel from Access."
Click on your office button.
Go to save as.
We're going to save macro enable workbook.
Let's name it book one and just say save.
"Now, we need to go into Access by clicking the start button, all programs, Microsoft Office."
Let's open Access.
We need to create a new database by clicking on the office button and saying new.
Let's leave the name as database one and say create.
Here's our new database.
"To run that macro from Excel macro from Access, hold down the ALT key on the keyboard."
Let's begin by opening up Excel.
Press F11.
This brings up the visual basic code editor.
Go to the top.
Say insert.
We're going to say module.
"In our code editor, we're going to begin typing in some code."
"Now that we have our function created in Access, I'm going to go over it with you real quick."
First thing it does is it creates a variable called Excel and the sign says Excel value.
"To the create object function, it launches a new Excel dot application scheme."
It then opens up a Excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that I typed in and then it simply says Excel dot run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one.
Let's first create our macro by clicking the view tab.
You then could link to this function Excel test within an object in your database.
My name is Dave Andrews and I just showed you how to run an Excel macro from Access.
Go into macros and saying record macro.
We're going to name this macro one just say okay.
"All this macro is going to do is type the number one, two, three, four across the top row."
"So, let's stop record by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record."
"Now, we have our macro created."
"So, let's save this as a macro enable workbook."
"MICHAEL ROSENGART: Right now, I'm here with two personal trainers, Ryan Regensburg and Jonesy and we're doing some renegade rows."
"So, what I want you to do is go ahead and get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands, whereas Ryan's going to show us later on a little variation for it."
"So, basically, he's just going to work one side at a time."
The hand on the ground will give him a little more support and will make it a little easier.
"And then once he does five, he's just going to switch over to the other side."
"Again, for this workout, we're working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation that I want you to work on or consider if you can do it, is a push up renegade row like Jonesy's doing here."
"Each time you're going down, you're going to do a push up and then come back up."
"It helps for a couple of different reasons, it helps again, to condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up--stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row."
Alright.
Good.
"And then once you've done with fifteen or twenty reps, grab some water, meet us on the next exercise in the next clip."
Jonesy's here in a push up position.
"And what you're going to do is you're going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your rib cage, shifting your weight back and forth."
"Now, if you're just starting on this, you may want to work with really wide feet."
"That will give you more balance and support as you perform, alright?"
"At the same time, if you want a little bit more of a challenge, bring your feet closer together as you work."
Exhale as you pull up and you're going to feel that you really get to use your abdominals and your obliques as you go back and forth.
"Ryan, go ahead and get down."
And Ryan's going to do a one-handed renegade row.
"Now that we've blow dried and separated all the sub-sections, what we're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products."
"What I like to do first is I like to heat the hair up just a little bit, especially just on the ends."
Does it make the shine stay more?
It does.
"Basically what I do by heating up the hair, and you'll notice when you put it in, it kind of melts in your hair."
It's like putting butter.
"When you heat up butter, butter is going to spread better, so basically that's what this is."
It's like spreading butter.
Does it help with the dryness?
It's not going to help with the dryness.
The moisturizing conditioner is what's going to help with the dryness of your hair.
"What this is going to do is just help to keep its shape, what we're going for."
We're just going to heat up the hair.
"It's pliable and it's fibrous, and it gives you some of that separation you want on your ends."
Heat it up in your palms and just pull it through.
There we go.
Let's go ahead and go on to our next section.
Then what I like to do is go on with my fiber pliable paste.
A lot of people ask me why do you use that product before you go ahead and finalize and finish it.
I like to think about it as getting your car painted.
Do you know what they do before they paint your car?
They prime it.
Basically what this is doing for me is priming your hair and getting it ready for that last shot of color.
"In this case, hairspray."
Urban legends are often the unwritten beliefs that people have and announce to others.
"Well, what are the unwritten rules for women about dating."
They're no more successful than you are. The probability is you're more successful They may have their own agenda as well.
"So, I would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girl friends to give you valid input for your choices."
That's what it's all about.
This is Dr. Paul.
May your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow.
"This is Dr. Paul, author of Boomer Girls, a boomer woman's guide to men and dating and host of Ask Dr. Paul."
"If they're unwritten, then how do we know them?"
"Well, they're passed on, and the best thing I can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman, as a woman, to give you valid information."
"Guess what, ladies, they're as equally involved with finding the answers as you are, and they're not going to find them from asking you because you're also asking them."
It's a vicious cycle.
"If you have questions, as I often say, if you want to find out about a man, why ask a woman, ask a man, ask Dr. Paul."
"If you're at the point, where you're asking your girlfriends for their opinions and their input, then you're doing the wrong thing."
"So, the unwritten beliefs that you're going to get, that data that you need, from your girl friends, is totally, absolutely, unequivocally wrong."
Hi everybody I'm John Graden from the Martial Arts Teacher's Association and johngraden.com.
How do you practice your kickboxing moves?
"Every time you throw your reverse move you always close the gap on your opponent, come in, engage, and then clear step out, re-open the gap with a clearing technique, I like to clear with a jab or I'll clear with the front leg round kick."
"So I engage, step in, fire, fire, fire, clear and then here is the biggy, change my alignment on the bag or the target and then repeat the process."
"So we are mixing our snapping techniques not just doing power all the time, two, every attack penetrating footwork, engage, clearing footwork, change your alignment that's always the pattern."
"Penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment, penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment."
Make sure that that is the pattern you are developing in the gym so that when you are in the ring that is how your fight comes out.
I'm John Graden.
I hope that helps.
Thanks very much.
That's a great question.
As a kickboxer this is one I'm particularly fond of.
Here is a common mistake that people make when they are dong their kickboxing moves.
If I am hitting the bag or I'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move.
"They'll try and slam the bag every move and what happens when you do that is one, you waste a lot of energy, two, you tense the body up, three you tend to run out of gas faster."
You don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how is that?
"I'll have techniques that I'm just going to snap and I'm just going to pop out there so I might go snap, snap, snap, snap, snap and about every seventh or eight go pow, pow, pow, pow, pow and then I recover."
"Pow, pow, pow, pow so I'm mixing my snapping my speed techniques with my power techniques, two, every time you step in and every time you throw a technique you want to make sure you're penetrating with your footwork and you are not standing in one spot digging a hole."
"Now depending on your style of play, if you like to play offense or defense you should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field."
If you're willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates who move forward.
"Now if defense isn't your thing and you like to play more offense, when you're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense."
"Ask them where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to, be able not get shot at from an area where you're not looking."
"If you're playing offense and you're up front, make sure you're laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team from not shooting at you."
"This medicine has been around for over 5,000 years."
"Before recorded history, between 100 BC and 200 AD The Yellow Emperor's Classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon in the China continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosophies that were also moving across."
You had observation as the key point.
"It was sacrilegious to dissect the human body so the systems of acupuncture, acupressure, as well as the use of herbs all came about through trial and error and they all came about through the constellations of the stars and the idea reflected of the micro and the macro so that points were developed for the purpose of releasing this natural flow of Chi."
In this next segment we will talk about the six external causes of illness.
"If you look out on the market, you're going to find a lot of different types of equipment."
"The two big ones, I want to talk about though right now, are metal versus plastic."
"If you remember, to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat."
"Typically, if you find metal processors, you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better."
You also want to look for good mixing as well.
"Also, because we are dealing with a flammable substance, methanol, it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tanks."
"Also, if you're heating within the tank, you don't want your tank to melt on you, so I kinda recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks."
"Do your research, look hard but look for the plastic, look for the metal, see which ones work the best for you."
"Again, calling it referrals, but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with metal tanks."
"Now the next environmental factors that you want to look at are the date, and the year."
When does this take place?
Is it taking place in the summer?
The fall?
The spring?
"These are real important things, because let's say it's taking place in New Orleans in the summer."
"Well, that means it's going to be hot and muggy, and that's going to directly affect how your character's going to respond."
"Or is it taking place in North Dakota in the winter, where it's very, very cold?"
"That will affect how your character reacts and responds and moves, and so forth and so on."
"You also need to take a look at the time period, in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this play or movie take place?"
Is it a day?
Is it a week?
Is it 1912?
Is it a month?
Is it a year?
"Does everything usually take place in the morning, or in the middle of the night, or in the daytime?"
All of those things can affect how your character acts.
"Also, you also want to take into consideration the date."
"Meaning, are there any specific holidays?"
Does this take place on a Sunday?
What do people usually do on Sunday?
Does it take place on a Monday?
What are people usually doing on a Monday?
Is it 1960's?
"Does it take place over St. Patrick's Day, or President's Day, or Christmas?"
Take into effect all of those environmental factors.
Is it 2008?
Is it in the future?
"Going to be real important to know what time period, because people acted differently; the social norms were different, in different time periods."
You also want to take a look at the season.
What time of year does this take place?
"And it could change, throughout the play or the movie, but is it taking place in the winter?"
Hello.
My name is Zephyr Clarke-Dolberg from Miami Dog Training.
"So I'm going to ex, ex, show you an example of that right now."
You notice she stays behind me.
She's not advancing forward because she needs to read my body language to see what she should do next.
She should be always looking for a cue from you.
"So, and as you can see when I stop she sits and she's relaxed."
"So, when you're walking your dog you always want to stay controlled."
And always walk them on one side so they're not confused about going back and forth.
This is Zephyr Clarke-Dolberg and this has been how to walk a dog.
In this clip we're going to teach you how to walk a dog.
Now number one is with the leash.
"Sometimes, you know, people get confident, over confident with their dogs off leash and, you know, something spooks a dog, it sees a cat, it runs out into the street and that can cause problems."
So walking a dog number one should be done on the leash.
Preferably a five to six foot leash.
I prefer a five foot leash.
"And a leather leash, you know, your tools are, are your biggest asset when you're working with your dog or walking with your dog."
"So, walking with your dog, you always want to make sure that you are the leader you're in the front."
"On this segment we're going to talk about foot brush sets, and combinations. It's very important when you're setting your foot brushes to put it in the right spot."
"It makes it a lot easier to, to complete the move."
"So you really want your, your foot brushes to be right in front of you, so when you go to set it up and kick it, it's going to be right in your wheelhouse."
"So now the wind has changed directions a little bit, so we're going to maybe go here."
So I'm going to toss it to Ryan; he's going to set it up for a foot brush for me.
"And if you notice, it was right in the perfect spot, right here, off of his set to my foot brush."
"Now, if you want to do several different combinations where you're putting a couple of the foot brushes together, you could toss it up, kick it here, toss it up, here, here, here."
So you can do tons of different combos.
"You can actually go there, left foot and right foot."
RICHARD BUCCOLA: Hi.
"All right, we put our garlic in a bowl and now, we're going to just cut up some celery as well."
"I'm just going to cut off the top end of that celery and what I want to do is just give it a good slice lengthwise and maybe another time lengthwise, that's pretty good, just them out them together and just start to cut tiny little pieces."
"I'm cutting these down, I'm going to cut all the way through."
"We only need about a quarter cup of celery, but I like to chop these down even finer."
"So what I'll do is then start again doing my chopping motion of my blade, coming--the back of the blade coming up and down."
"All right, I got these chopped real fine the way I want it so I'm just going to add it to my bowl and I'm going to then chop up our zucchini."
We're just trying to chop up everything so it's all prepped; this is all our prep work right now.
So come on back.
How you doing?
If you see any browning or it is kind of hard that means that it is a older lime and you don't want to go around that lime you want it to stay away from that.
With your Serrano's you also want them to be bright green and just look around and make sure that there is no holes or bruising.
You onions are kind of hard to tell what your onions look likes because it has a wrap around it you just want to go around the onion and kind of feel and make sure there is no holes or anything like that and the same thing with the shallots.
You want to go around and make sure there is no holes and that is how you can pick ingredient for making this meal.
The first thing on this I'm going to do is show you how to pick out ingredients.
"First of all you have the tomato, the tomato needs to be nice and firm all the way around."
You want there to be no bruising or no big dents and you want it to be bright red.
The avocado for the guacamole now you want this avocado to be nice and tender.
"You don't want it to be real hard or anything like that, you want to be able to push this circle button on the very top to push that button in and if sinks in like that then that it is nice and firm in the inside."
You got your mango we want to make sure that your mango is pretty tender so if you push it down you can go in but you don't want it to be so soft where you thumb goes right through.
You want it to be kind of firm but at the same time you want it to be also tender.
Same thing with your lime you want to see a nice tenderness going all the way around it and you want it to be bright green.
The first product that I'm going to talk to about is a product called Egyptian Magic.
"This is one of my favorite things to use for hair, skin, lips, soars, everything."
Just to get that scalp extra happy and extra moisturized.
Since it's just been pulled on for an extended amount of time.
It's great.
"Now when it comes to this product, the best quality about it is that it's all natural ingredients."
"As you can see, it kind of starts out looking like a wax, but when you dig some out, you just stick it in your hand and then it melts slowly and turns into oil."
"This makes it really easy to massage into a scalp and to run through somebodies hair. This, I really like to use in pretreatment."
"If you rub a lot of this throughout the hair, it's kind of like a leave in conditioner and it keeps it moisturized throughout the whole braiding process."
"That way it doesn't dry out anytime in the middle, but it's great for your skin."
"Also, after braiding style is complete, it's good to just take a little bit and run it in between each braid."
In this next clip we're going to talk about wind chill and wind chill factors.
This is a critical consideration when you're dealing with the outdoors.
This wind chill chart is available from the NOA weather and the National Weather Service as a free download from their website.
The wind chill and your dress.
"You dress for wind chill, not for the temperature that you have outside."
"For instance right here, since we been filming here for this clip, a cloud came over and the temperature dropped ten degrees just in the last two minutes."
And the wind chill actually adds extra to that temperature drop.
"So wind chill, we'll take a look at this wind chill chart and I'll show you what kind of temperature drops you have even for a minor change in the wind."
"On this wind chill chart you have the temperature across the top, and then you have the wind speed along the sides."
"And then you just cross reference your data and you'll come up with the actual real temperature, real life temperature that you have to dress for."
A five degree shift in the wind will drop the actual real life temperature ten to fifteen degrees.
I'm going to show you how to make a Bluebird.
Now this drink is stirred and not shaken so you don't need much ice.
"Despite it's blue flavor, it has an orange taste behind it."
Then you're going to add a couple dashes of bitters so have that handy.
Do just a couple.
That should be good.
And then you're going to stir it so have your stirrer available.
Put it in and twist it around just like that.
Looks good.
Then you're going to strain it in to a glass.
"So, grab your glass, have your stainer available and gently pout it in."
Just like so.
So take it put it in to your glass.
"And you're going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist, that you can twist."
"Pour in just like that, put in your straw and then you have a Blue Bird."
You're going to add an ounce and half of gin.
So get your jigger.
"Pour in an ounce, flip it over and add the half of ounce."
"Then you're going to add an ounce of trip sec, actually half an ounce of triple sec."
Just grab that.
To the small side of the jigger.
You're going to do an half an ounce of blue Curacao.
We're going to do gathering chi from heaven and earth.
"And I want you to, if you'd like to follow along with me, that'd be great."
"There are so many movements in Qigung that, when you learn a great amount of Qigung, you could pick what you would like to do, what your body can handle."
OK?
"And, a real simple one is gathering chi from heaven and earth."
And what I'd like to do is demonstrate the form for you and kind of just talk through the form as you're watching me do this.
"So, we always want to start out in the Wu Chi posture."
"Right -- first one, always stand in the Wu Chi posture."
Work your way from the feet up to the top of the head.
"Once you do that, then you go to your breathing."
"Inhale, exhale."
OK?
"But gathering chi from heaven and earth, one of the great things about Qigung is that the movements can be very, very simple."
"From here, once you have a feeling of peace and focus, that the mind isn't racing around anymore, that you're very calm and relaxed, let's begin the movement then."
"Then begin the posture and the movement is what we're going to do, which is gathering chi from heaven and earth."
We don't have to do any complex movements here.
There are complex movements later on in higher levels of Qigung.
But the wonderful thing about Qigung is that Quigung can be done with any age group.
Any age group.
"We have movements in Qigung that eighty year olds can do, ninety year olds can do."
"We have movements in Quigung that require stronger flexibility, more endurance and so on."
"But the point to this is that when you do Qigung, you can do so many different movements."
"Hi, my name's Floyd, I'm talking to you today from theacousticmusician.com in Sandy, Utah, and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music today."
The most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature.
"And that is this line here, and what it is is each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar."
"This would be your high E, this would be your low E, and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play."
Now the line up here is standard notation which a lot of people don't know how to read.
But this just shows finger position and note placement on the strings to be able to play the guitar.
"Now first of all, I want to tell you, when you are doing business over the phone, you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate."
"And what I'm talking about is, no longer do you have any non-verbalâs to work with."
"Whoever's on the other end of that phone, they can't see your face, they can't see your body, they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment."
So basically all you're left with is your tone of voice.
"Your attitude, which comes through in your tone of voice, and this is what you have to work with."
This is what will convey your professionalism.
"This is what will convey your willingness to listen, and to help, and to be a professional."
So it's very important that we focus on the specifics of working with such few things.
Minimum 1x3 counter battens are run vertical and centered over existing rafters.
A moisture membrane of felt Tri Flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lap to allow the membrane to loop over the counter battens.
The main framing and details are then continued.
Care must be taken to protect the membrane from penetrations.
All cuts and penetrations should be sealed with tape.
In a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a back set fascia you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles.
"In order to hold the panels in plain, you will need to install a filler strip to support the back of the first course in lieu of the batten, usually a 1 inch wide board will suffice."
"I'm with the Kelly White Team, and today we're going to tell you how to buy a house."
But most of the time it's a pleasant surprise.
"What we do with that prequalification letter, when time comes to present the offer, we always include the prequalification letter for 2 reasons."
"First of all, it shows the seller that you are serious and it shows the realtor that you do have that money to purchase that house."
A prequalification is really important.
"The prequalification letter; it's very, very important for so many reasons."
"A prequalitfication letter is you're going to meet with a mortgage broker and the mortgage broker is going to run all your numbers, find your credit score and everything."
It's going to find out how much that bank can lend you.
"Because, this is important, you're not really buying the house, the bank is buying the house."
The bank is loaning you the money to buy that house.
This is a a prequalification letter.
"The reason it's important is, first of all, we find out how much you can spend."
Sometimes it's a pleasant surprise; sometimes it's oh my God.
"Because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case, *73."
Listen and it will undo that call forwarding.
Each phone company will have a different sequence of numbers.
"So make sure you check that before you start, take advantage of that facility."
"But call forwarding is a really, really great tool for home or for business."
Kathy Pabst Robshaw telephone effectiveness.
"It's really easy to do, you can forward a call from your home phone to your cell, to your office, to your neighbor, all you need to do is make sure you've got the number that your phone company has allocated to you."
In my case it's 73.
"I hit *73, here a message, it tells me what to do."
"Generally, I would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to, and then automatically it happens, I don't think about it."
"Hang up, walk away, it happens."
The easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you've used so that you can undo it.
"Once again this is something that we, we don't sell a whole lot of these days, but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all out there still use Chlorine."
"This, this is a very good way of being able to test the level of Chlorine that you have in your water."
"So, with that being said, that's just a little bit about Chlorine Test Papers."
How does a snake grow?
Well that's a good question.
"Obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they are going to shed a lot less but they do need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales, repair any damage that may have occurred and continue on with their healthy life."
Snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do.
People shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around.
"Snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they don't allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake, well not really too much of a baby any more."
"What they do is they rub their head against something, here's the head over here."
They rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out.
When it comes off of them and it is inside out.
Then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake.
A baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really varies as to how often they're going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing.
Hi!
Now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again.
Just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip.
As long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't be coming out there.
You pull that through.
See how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and I will show you what to do.
"Okay so then once we get a bunch f those, we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together."
It almost looks ike a seam.
"So the smaller the stitches, the more delicate the repair will be."
Now I am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch.
Okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment.
Match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what I am doing and what the stitch looks like I am going to use black thread.
That should make it easier for you to see this.
You want to knot your thread like I showed you; nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip.
"You are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch, probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it; where you came out, you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider."
"You are going to start very small and close and a little wider, a little wider and you will see what we are going to get."
"There you go. Now your stitches start off small, bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip; about an eighth of an inch and go in down here."
"You can't see it, so I don't know what to explain it, it's not a box blade so whatever, when you have it at an angle, whatever, whatever catches on this side is gonna ride down and gonna run out that side so you're gonna have, you'll have stock piled down at the end."
It doesn't gather it up on both side and bring it through.
It'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side.
"But this, unlike the box blade, is not boxed in, so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side."
"And you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road, off to the side of the road, and that's what this kind of blade would be for."
This is a tire pressure gauge.
"You check the pressure of the tires and to change tire pressures every time you come in, depending on track conditions, the track continues to change every single time you go out there."
"This is really easy to use, its got a number gauge on it."
You just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read.
You just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire.
Its really easy to use.
"You can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is pressurized, the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out."
It depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two PSI your taking in or out of the tire.
"Hi, this is Jon, and in this clip we'll be talking about the portable shop table."
"As you begin to accessorize your wood shop, you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table."
"You'll notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs, and at the other side we just have our standard feet."
"Now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station, so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station, maybe you're going to a table saw or a planer."
"Now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic and comfortable, or if you're looking for more of a custom, mobile workbench, you can always go on line and search for ""free mobile workbench plans"" and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself."
Now you'll notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal.
"Now if the surface gets scratched, it will scratch your lumber, so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one, you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched, you could refinish it and make it smooth again."
And now we're going to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board.
Here we have the Denon DNC635 CD player.
"Important things you need to know about the Denon player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that's called Push, and you turn it sideways."
"Don't push it, turn it sideways."
And you can see the track numbers is advancing.
"One, two, three."
OK?
So there we go.
That's how you change tracks.
"And when you're ready to play, hit play, obviously."
"Now a great feature of the Denon CD player is, if you decide this is the track you want, instead of hitting pause, which just pauses it, or hitting stop, which actually would bring you back to track one, you can hit, go find the track you want again, track three in this case."
Hit play.
Has many features.
Yes that's what I want.
"And then you hit the Cue button and what that does is, is it brings you back to the beginning of track three."
"So find your track with the, turning this button that says Push on it, paradoxically."
And then use Cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play.
Some of which aren't fantastically useful.
Let's play some music here.
OK.
So it has your basic CD player features.
"Stop, obviously, duh."
"Play, woohoo."
"And you know Pause, no surprise there."
"Another very good use, although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a backboard in a cross moving current."
"Now while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort, so you can use it."
"You need a lot of people, the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where it's positioned in the middle."
"The head should be at the front, so that way if the feet get dropped into the water, the water will tend to plane the backboard up to the surface of the water."
Now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the backboard.
If at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board.
"If you have the opportunity to do this, that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their airway."
So I'm going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down.
And I'm going to show you how we're going to mark where we're going to cut off the pants.
"Okay, so now that I have this pressed down, I'm going to go ahead and flip these pants back out, because I need to see that excess fabric, so I can determine where I'm going to cut it off."
"Okay, here we go."
"And when I do this, if I have to cut off the fabric I like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside."
"And that's a good idea just in case, say someone else wants to wear them, they'll have a little bit to work with."
"If they need to let the hem out, because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left."
"So, I'm just going to start right here where I put that one little seam that I sewed myself, and mark 1 inch."
Here we go.
"And on this side, and also on the next side."
"Okay, it's all the way around."
"So, in a minute I'm going to show you how, I'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off."
"So let's go over here to my work table/ironing table, and here we go."
And I'll show you how to do that next.
"So the first thing I want to do is go ahead and iron this down, just like I did the other leg, just kind of pull it a tiny bit, there we go."
I'm just going to iron right here along the seam.
"And like I said before, I like do that just because I know the fabric is right were it's supposed to be, and you give it that little press."
"Now this side, okay."
"Then we're going to open it and get that crease that I put there, out."
I'm going to do the inside also.
"Okay, because we've already done this once, so I'm just going to get after and do it."
Okay sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and cajun cooking or sausage making is that they stuff about anything.
"Into the casings and the sausage of you can do rabbit you can do goose, you can do chicken, turkey, catfish I mean basically anything."
The trick is to figure out the right seasonings that goes well with those meats that you use for that sausage.
Today what were going to do is a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and were going to use some pork to actually bine that together.
Another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg whites to create that bite.
For this recipe were going to use a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our fillings so let's get started.
"Ace 2 suited, ace 3 suited; this is pretty much the best Omaha high low hand because what it gives you gives you the aces you can win the high if you catch another ace or two."
It gives you suited ace 2 and suited ace 3.
"With these, you can pick up a high of a straight, you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush."
So you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low.
What does that mean visually?
Well let's take a look at this board here that I laid out.
We got a board of Jack 10 8 3 and 5 and our opponent has played a rather another and for Omaha high low.
But played it none the less and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to a queen.
At last he does not win the low with his 5-2 and he doesn't even qualify for a low because he matches the 5.
"We on the other hand have a low hand, we have 8, 5, 3, deuce, ace so we would win half of the pot."
"So we have the bottom prepared, and we've got our little bowl that has the pedestal, and this is set up as well."
It also is leather hard.
"So again, I'm going to spin it, and I'm going to tap it on center."
"And press down in the middle, you notice it slid at first, that was the suction releasing."
"You press down in the middle, and that recreates that suction."
"So it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming, that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center."
"And next, we'll trim it."
"Now, as you can see when I set it on there, it's a little too big."
It doesn't quite slip into that pedestal.
So I have to trim this as well.
"So, what I need to do, in order to trim this, first you want to get the wheel head wet."
This is important because I just use suction to hold my pieces to the wheel.
"And that's going to happen because when I put this wet lip against this wet piece, and I'm going to drop it kind of hard."
And now it's sucked on there.
I'm hitting and it's not moving.
"Hi, my name is Dave Schoeneck and we're talking about how you're going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing."
In some of the things to prepare would be obviously some upper body stretching.
It's going to be how much fun you had and you just wont be able to wait until you get back up and do it again.
Upper body and abdominal exercises.
That always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sore.
You probably will use muscles that you haven't used before but with that soreness will come a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun.
At having being out on the mountain and just you wont be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again.
"But again, the more and more you can prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be."
"Some of the muscles that you'll use would be obviously your forearms, your biceps, your lats, your back."
"There'll be a number of things you will, can't find muscles that you didn't, forgot you even had but those are really the upper body is doing a awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work."
So but again the biggest thing that you're going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles.
Okay.
"Our fish has been in the oven for about 20 minutes, so now it's time to take it out."
"This is -- we're just going take our knife and the broccoli, and just cut the ends off of our florets like so."
Just enough for two people is what we need to do.
"And if you have more than two people, you're welcome to save these stems and eat them too, if you'd like."
I happen to prefer just the broccoli florets.
"And to this, we're going to go over to the sink so we can put an inch of water."
We just need a little bit of water in here at the bottom -- just a little bit of water.
And I'm going to put the broccoli florets in here like so.
"I'm going to cover them, and I'm going to put them on the stove -- here we go -- and I'm going to boil them with high heat."
"So just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming, so it's not going to be overcooked so it's going to be a bright green."
"And I'm going to check them every once in a while, but it takes about 10 minutes to cook."
"You can see the garlic is still in there, and here's our fish packet."
"So keep clicking, we're getting close to putting it all together."
Yum.
The garlic still needs to cook.
Here we go.
"Now, we're just going to let this sit here and do what I like to call residual cooking."
"Actually, all meats do that when you take them out of the heat, the heat that's in there continues to cook the meat."
"And that's what's going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture, soft texture."
"So meanwhile, let's just quickly do our broccoli."
I got my first job back in 1984 on a TV series called Miami Vice.
"They were down in Miami filming locally, of course, where the series was shot."
"I think I was a little bit thinner, a lot thinner then and I had really high cheekbones and because of the way I looked, somehow I had a Russian look to me."
"And the director who happened to be Eddie Olmos who played Capt. Castillo on the series, he saw my face and said, ""Strong face, great bones."
Looks Russian to me.
"Let's put him in the suit"", so to speak."
So I was an ex-KGB guy running around trying to kill Crockett and Tubbs with a machine gun for most of the show.
I think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with a real high quality project.
I did Monster with Charlize Theron in 2004.
And it was a little independent movie.
"It was actually lower that the Screen Actors Guild's standard, and we all got a low budget pay for it."
"And a call came out to all the actors, aspiring actors in the area, that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and were comfortable in front of a camera, to work on a TV show called Miami Vice."
"But, you know, that's the great thing about this business, you never know where or how the project you're taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated, you know, as some films do."
"And for her, it got her an Academy Award."
So I was in a scene with Charlize Theron in Monster.
"And during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that, I think that it was either the Screen Actors Guild Award show, which was telecast on TNT or something, Turner's Broadcasting who showed that, she mentioned my name."
She thanked me.
And I only worked one night with her.
We had a long scene to do.
"I remember it being very cold and I was very bloody and in my underwear, which makes you wonder, wow, I've got to go back and rent that now."
"So yeah, do that, go rent it because residuals also help us actors and anything you can do to help me, I'd appreciate it."
"So, go rent the movie and check out the scene."
"So I went in, not knowing what to expect, really, you know."
This was my first introduction to it and I got sides.
"And I was told, you know, ""Memorize these sides or look at them and then come back in and I'm going to put you on camera doing this."""
So I did that and they liked me.
And I got hired as an actor on Miami Vice.
That was my first job.
And I was playing a Russian KGB agent.
"As you are getting ready for the ball to come over the net and to hit it, it's important that you're moving side to side and then bouncing on the balls of your feet."
You should never just stay put.
You should be moving because that's going to give you the energy to get the ball.
"You should have your knees bent, your feet spread out, moving side to side."
Then your back should be angled so that you are ready to move.
If you were leaning back like this it's going to be harder to get up to go get the ball.
"So when it's all working right, you're going to have your feet moving all the time, your hands and your racket moving side to side, your shoulders, your eyes following the ball."

"What you're going to want to do is, go and measure where the fence is going to be, and make yourself a hand drawn diagram."
"Here we've measured out our yard, and determined that we're going to have a certain footage on this side, along the back the other side, and drawn it out how we want it to lay out with the fence and the gates."
"From this hand drawn diagram, you can then come up with a custom layout, depending on what spacing you want to set your post."
We've got a custom layout here that goes right along with that hand drawn diagram.
"Where we've taken a 77 inch center to center spacing, which is a 72 inch opening between post, and figured out what each side- how many sections would be on each side, determining which post would be required, and how many of each kind of post."
"With this diagram, you can then prepare to lay out the job on the ground."

I think we pretty much fixed our leaky little problem in here.
So what we did was we took this old housing off and replaced our old leaky cartridge which is this one with a brand new one.
I think we've probably solved our problems.
"At this point, is not going to be anymore leaks in this shower."
"Again, this is something that you can do at home."
It is really not hard if you know the tricks and that is it for me today.
"Normally what I would do if I was doing a spell for healing, is I would write out a petition."
"And that would be almost like a prayer, saying what I intend to do and for whom I intend to do it."
"Then I sometimes use a poppet, as I had mentioned before, and I wrap herbs around it."
"Or if say they had a broken leg, I would concentrate the healing on the leg part."
"Sometimes what I do is I'll take a photograph and put the photograph over the face, so that it actually looks like the person."
That's called sympathetic magic.
"Where I'm not actually doing the magic on somebody, but I'm doing it on something instead."
"And then I would place it on the pentacle, and I would continue with the spell saying what I would want for the healing and want for the person."
"And of course, for the highest good of all, and that it harm none."
Now we're going to be talking about direction of the ball.
"Basically, you have two directions that we're going to be talking about."
"For forehand on the line, the same concept; you're going to be hitting the ball."
You're going to hit it just a little more behind.
"One thing, as you notice we don't have any three point lines here but, that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during, sometime during that period, is the three point line."
"The three point line is actually, I talked about it earlier, is nineteen point nine for college and high school, and actually NBA, the NBA line is a little further out, it's at twenty three, nine, twenty three feet, nine inches."
"So, same shooting mechanics apply and there you have it, shooting the three point shot."
"So, whenever you're shooting same shooting mechanics apply."
"You want to take your, take your three point shot."
"I'm going to show you, I'm going to take, actually go across court here and show you exactly, what a round about what a three point shot would be, being is how we don't have, actually have a three point line on our court."
"So, check me out."
"When you're coming over here and you're shooting a three point shot, same shooting mechanics apply as a regular shot, no changes, you just might, down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot, unless you're strong enough to actually get it there with a set shot."
"So, when you're taking a, taking your three point shot, you want to make sure if you're playing outside, outdoors, you got to allot for the wind, that's the thing about playing outside."
You've always got to allot for the wind.
"So, if you're taking this a little more distance, so when you're shooting the three point shot, you allot for the wind and there you go just like that, you take the shot."
Okay so our kimchi is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pickling process happen for a good solid 1/2 hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kimchi.
"The cucumber is not stiff anymore, I mean it would still break and when you eat it, it has a nice crunch to it."
So once it is ready all we have to do is revisit our rice which is now done is the rice cooker.
Spoon some of it wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi.
"You can do it over the rice, the side of the rice, you can do it however you like and if you are really ambushes and you went to the Asian market and got some kimchi traditional kimchi."
I'm going to put that in to and there you have your basic Korean meal vegetarian.
One of the ways that I like to continue to create my sound is I use what is called a loop station.
"A loop station is basically a live recording its a XOR input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have, that goes into the loop station and what you do is your press basically a peddle and it starts to record."
"When you press the peddle again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience, and doing so you can create a mean sound with a lot of stuff layered on top of it."
It's very creative way to show people what your about to help facilitate really what your music is about and creating a sound on stage.
People really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to broaden your musical horizons.
Just trim off the little root section and peel off that outer brown skin now to chop an onion you want to leave that little root section on there.
"And when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you don't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart, if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together, see how the onion stays together."
And then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section.
"Set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off, and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vapors you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted, and it's very quick to cut an onion like this."
Just continue that with all your onions now I'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off.
"Another way to crush the garlic is to take a steardy glass or jar and just give that a little whack that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off, I'm just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we'll prep the leak."
My name is Kristy I'm working at the Curves in West Jordan Utah.
We are talking about weight loss tips.
And there's different ways to we support our ladies through exercising three times a week.
A really good way to lose weight sometimes is a support group.
"Having friends to do it with you, family members or even joining the support group."
"At curves we do offer nutrition classes, that is a group of ladies that are all the same goal, we meet once a week and we talk about suggestions for each other."
Tips on different salad dressings we've used that are lower fat that taste better.
"Just to have a group of women doing it with you or even friends, or a spouse, someone that's there to support you that knows what you are going through."
And can help you through it and you can help them.
So you know if you want to find one you can bring a friend if not if you do go to a facility like curves or other facilities they do offer support groups where you can do it with a group of friends and you can all lose weight together.
"Another part of our support group is we , with these ladies on the wall, they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people make it, find it hard to work out, they stay in our camp and we keep track of them call them let them know that we are, they haven't hit there three times a week that week."
"When you're running a press, the defense is running a press, one thing that you want to learn how to do, is break that press."
"Hi, I'm Travis and I'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that, when you're on the basketball court."
"Once, that is the key to breaking the press."
"The press, once a guard has the ball, in the middle of the court, the press is pretty much broken, then the, then the thing is finding someone to pass it to, and getting it down court."
"So, try your best to get that person, whoever is going to have the ball, after it's inbound to get into the middle of the court, so that they have options on the right, and on their left."
"Once that happens, there you have it, breaking the press."
"Number one, when there is a press, a defensive press, what you want to make sure you do is, when you have the guy in, the person inbound the ball, you want to make sure that they have options."
"Somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble, cause you don't want them out of bounds for five seconds, when they get in trouble, they can find someone to pass it to."
"Usually, it'll be, you'll have two guards, you'll have your point guard, and your shooting guard back here."
"And, what they'll do for each other, is they'll set screens, and when he or she smacks the ball, you'll have them split, to try to get open, once the ball is inbound and they get the ball, then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game, and look for their options."
"Now, the two guards are back here, you'll have, you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key, on the opposite top of the key."
"But, you also want to have your forwards around half court, so that they have, so that your guards have options, if they get in trouble."
"Now, you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within, within the time frame, the ten second time frame, but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you're breaking that press, there's pressure, there's going to be pressure that gets you, that's what the press is."
"So, you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving, and constantly setting screens for each other, so they can get open."
"Next we are going to talk about is, I am going to do a necklace and I am going to make a turquoise necklace since I have lots of turquoise here to choose from."
I am going to use a toggle clasp which has a circle and it also has an end piece here with a chain.
Let?s see what would look nice with the necklace and I think this one would look nice as a centerpiece.
That would look really good.
And what we will do is we will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece.
There is the beads.
We will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design.
That will be the beginning of it.
So I am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace.
This is the type of bead I am going to use.
It?s called a flat disk.
There is also this type but I am going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it?s going to be sixteen inches.
"And most manufacturers when you buy your beads, they come in sixteen inch length."
Now because this is such a simple design here I thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice.
So I was going through my large beads here and I was looking to see which one would match up nicely.
This one looks a little too blue here.
A wrist control that we can use from a slashing attack.
We're going to do it from the outside.
I'm off the line of attack.
The blade's far enough away from me that if it misses it misses.
I'm here.
I'm here.
And then I control the hand.
He wants to bring it back naturally.
I'll flow with him.
We don't want to get into a wrestling match.
I don't want to fight him down here to keep it here.
He want to bring it up?
We want to create a protective barrier once again.
That's fine.
I'll go right with him.
Boom.
We want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible.
This motion is nice and small in an ever shrinking circle going gently past his forearm down into the ground.
I don't want to heave him 40 yards away.
I want him on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible.
Here and down we go to the ground.
And that is a good wrist control from a slashing attack.
Create a diversionary framework. A Danny comes in here I want to follow that motion. Trap on top of the wrist right here and as he begins to pull back to get into position I want to follow him once again.
A technique we have seen several times before.
Because it's exceptionally effective.
Which is why we're seeing it again.
Here I create my protective line.
I have some very good news for you about the Feral cat.
"The Los Angeles Police Department is now employing Feral cats, who otherwise would have been euphemized at shelters, to fight rats and mice at two police stations; one at the southeastern branch and the other, the central branch."
"Very cute, and of course, people want to buy them, they're Turkish Angoras."
The idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease.
"Right now, it's just a very cute idea."
And you know what I say to that?
"Meow, Meow, Meow."
"And they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats, they flee."
The cats don't even have to chase them.
"And it's said that at Parker Center, downtown LA, their main center, are now going to enjoy having the Feral cats drive out the rats there."
"And you know, I think this should be carried out around the country."
"Wherever there's a rat problem; whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the Feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise, I'm sorry to say, be euphemized."
"Now, from South Korea, we have another case of cats that's very interesting."
They've just cloned glow-in-the-dark kitties.
"Yes, they're giving them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultraviolet light."
Tonight we're going to work and walk you through some advance bowling techniques so you can improve your game.
From the stand point tonight we've covered a lot of information.
"We've talked basically about the stance, we've talked about how to move the ball through the stance, release position, spare shooting, how to change speed on the ball."
"We've given you a lot of information from a stand point, now it's time to take the information go out on the lanes and play with it."
Now there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking.
"The first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored, alright?"
"And those are some of the negatives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking, so just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech."
Know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them.
"And a lot of this has to do with structure, which I'm going to talk about in a minute, but you're thinking on your feet."
"You know the topic, but you have to, while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation, you have to keep your audience interested."
"You can't ramble on, you can't have random organizational patterns, you have to keep the audience with you."
So that's something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you.
"Obviously your goal, your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well, thought-out speech."
"Well, you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought-out speech, you just met the topic."
"So you have to try and present a well thought-out speech, but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time."
"You also, one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details -you haven't had time to research, you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech, so you're going to miss out on some of those details."
In this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of Qigong breathing.
"The essence of all Qigong exercises is in the exercise of the breath, and although there's wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular Qigong exercises we do, I like to talk more about the Western physiological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial."
"Will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing, that we'll talk about in the next segment."
"So remember, belly breathe is the way we're supposed to breathe."
One of the main reasons is the lymphatic system of our body.
The lymphatic system has two pumps.
"One we get through exercise, muscle contraction, and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm, the muscle that we're supposed to use in respiration."
"The dome shaped muscle that's here, right underneath our lungs, and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up."
"That action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of the lymphatic fluids of our body, lymph being, I hate to say it, the gook of our body, or the waste products of many of our body's systems."
"So, one of the best way we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing."
"It has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regulate the PH of our blood, which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis, and so although the calcium in our bones is the primary way, the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that."
"So, we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly."
I'm Veronyka Bass from Veronyka's Color Salon and Day Spa.
"Now we're going to have her lean back, get comfortable."
And this is where we're going to use the warm water.
More on the warm side than not hot or cold.
"So we're going to get ready to shampoo her, and at the very end of a shampoo, it's nice to give it a cold rinse, so it seals the cuticle."
Alot of people don't realize that.
"It's going to be a little bit of a cold shower, but it seals the cuticle."
Now I'm getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the pH balance down.
This will stop the total continuation of processing.
Right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project.
What I have here in my hand is a paint wheel.
It gives the different colors that independent stores would offer.
So you can have specific selections to choose from.
"Depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat, a eggshell, a satin, gloss, semi-gloss, all that can be done regardless of your color chooses."
Personally I would put a gloss or a semi-gloss on your doors and eggshells or a satin on your walls.
You can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well.
"The reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors, the different textures and also the ability and clean ability."
A higher gloss paint is going to give you a more cleanable surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean.
"Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software."
The sort of toxic goo that you wouldn't want to find yourself in.
So we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber 08 at all costs.
"We look over here on our left, we've got a power ball dispenser and an orange portal and a power conduit."
What we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit.
"But we need to be careful because, if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball, we will die."
So we need to find a different way of doing things.
A company with which I have no affiliation.
All right!
Here we are in test chamber 08.
We've got some new icons here now.
"We've got the old familiar power ball death, power ball power conduit, and now it looks like we've got some other ones."
The risk of drowning and don't drink the water.
So we look here in test chamber 08.
We can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic goo.
Alright the drink that we are about to make is a Black and Tan.
Now there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan.
"So anytime you want to spice up your Guinness a little bit, and you don't feel like having just a Bask, make yourself a Black and Tan, a mixture of both."
Bottoms up.
But if you ask most people they'll tell you that Guinness and Bask Ale.
"First thing we're going to do is we're going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your Bask, half way."
And we're going to fill it the rest of the way with Guinness.
And the Guinness is darker.
You will see the difference in the top and the bottom.
It should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see.
And the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom.
And that's a Black and Tan.
The next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach 44.
"And this one is really easy to find, it's literally between the second and third toe."
So you're just going to rub in between the toes.
"Just run your finger in there, massage in between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain, relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet massaged by their owners, they don't like them touched by the vets much, but quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything."
You can do a full foot massage on them if you like.
"There's good acupressure points in between the other toes as well, but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain in the back limbs."
So you'll want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he's compensating by using this leg.
So you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs.
You want to work that point.
"Again this is a massage, just rubbing that muscle between your fingers, the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard, feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area."
I'm here to discuss short curly locks with you.
Now Heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot.
She's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your highs speed or high temperature.
"The courser your hair is, the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair."
"Now if I grab this, the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they're going to fall."
"So you can see that the curl is very tight, very wiggly."
That is what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair.
It's going to help achieve your style and it's going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume.
The tools that you're going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron.
"Curling irons come in various diameters they come very small, 1/2"" they go to 3/4"", the 1"" 1 1/2"" and then the 2""."
The longer the larger the diameter the looser the weight is going to be.
"Now when somebody like Heather's hair, you also must take into consideration the length of her hair."
"If I was to use this on this section, it would only do one turn, it would be very very loose and it would literally use something like this on shorter hair just to kind to give it a little bevel around the face."
"Just to really kind to get the hair to either go under or flip out, the smaller diameter will work best on her hair."
Another great benefit with curling irons such as this one is does have a heat adjustment on it.
The heat adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order to cater to your hair.
We're now going to start lunging the horse.
You'll notice that I still have the chain over my horseâs nose.
This just gives me a little bit more control.
I also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides he doesn't want to behave and stay on the circle.
It also lets you grip the lunge line a little bit better.
I also have a lunge whip and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we're also in an enclosed arena.
So that if something does go wrong he can't get out.
So I'm going to start by just letting him come into a small circle around me.
Hi.
We're back stage and I've got to get all my models ready and we've got to use hair extensions.
These are so wonderful and quick to use.
"Listen, if you've got a party to go to. If you have a prom. Or you have any type of occasion you can use some temporary hair extensions."
Now they only last for a couple of days and these are clip in so they won't hurt your hair.
"Remember, anything is possible with a little creativity."
"Just remember, stick it and click it."
"They're so easy, so easy to remove and something that everybody can do."
You could even take it after you clip it in and create a pony tail or pin it up and have an up do.
"So remember, temporary hair extensions are an ideal way to get a fabulous new look."
"So today, I'm going to share with you how to use temporary hair extensions."
I gotta get these girls ready for the show.
"Listen, go find your hair extensions today."
My name is Sylvia Russell and this is how you can use temporary hair extensions.
They're fast and easy.
"By the way, my name is Sylvia Russell."
"Listen, these are the easiest hair extensions that you can buy."
"They have little clips on them, so you simply just stick it in the hair and clip it."
How easy is that?
"Now listen, these you can get at your local beauty supply store."
You can even ask your stylist about these.
So we are in the roll your own portion of shotgun.
We've each rolled one card we've had a betting round.
So we're all selling here and considering that these hands are on similar footing I don't think any of us are going away but you should bet and we'll talk more about that in the next segment.
What happens now?
Well we're going to roll another card right?
Player to my left rolls a jack of hearts to match his queen of hearts.
We see what he's trying to sell there right?
He's trying to sell a straight or a flush or a straight flush or a royal flush.
You roll a ten to match your jack which is also the same suit.
You too are trying to sell a straight a flush a straight flush or a royal.
To your left we see again a sales pitch and I roll out a potential straight.
Hello welcome back!
In this segment we're going to be discussing how to make the client comfortable on the massage table.
"There we go, are you comfortable?"
"I am, great!"
Can you lift your knees for me please?
Do you have any aches or pains?
A little on the hip.
On the hip?
Have you had a massage before?
No.
"No, okay great!"
Is there any part of you body that you would like special attention paid to?
"So in this case we're working with a massage table, other individuals if they're in chair or in a bed, you'll deal with that as it presents itself to you."
"A lot of stress right now, so I think just whatever that will help me relax."
"Great, we can do that."
"So after we find out what the needs are of our client and make sure your client is comfortable, then we're set to move on to the next segment."
So Molinia do you care to demonstrate with me?
"I'm going to first have you sit up, great!"
"So when the individual gets on the table, first we have them sit on the side."
Can you swing your legs around?
There you go!
"So they first get on the table like this and then we have them swing their legs onto the table, great!"
"Then, slowly lower yourself supporting her back and her head."
The principles of Aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations.
"It can be applied in your family with your spouse, with your kids."
"In that, that last technique, as Phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction."
We can see exactly what they are seeing.
We can get a little different perspective.
If we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately.
As he attacks just turn and go right in.
Everything is blending and harmonizing.
Some can be a little more direct.
Others can just not connect with that energy.
If it is negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it.
There are many different ways as you can see to deal with each individual situation and Aikido principles will help you deal with that in daily life.
It can be applied at work with an irate boss or co-worker.
It could be an upset driver.
It could be somebody with road rage.
We are going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques to emphasize the principles and why don't we just take a peek.
"For example if there is somebody coming at you with road rage it is probably best not to block, not to stop them with your car but just to let them go right by and with Aikido it looks something like this."
I'll show you.
"So that is one way, you can just let them go right by."
If you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this.
"This yogurt is a Bulgarian yogurt that is non fat so it really healthy, it is a little more on the sour side as far as yogurts go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour."
I will definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt so so good.
Yogurt in the middle east is kind of like ketchup here in the United States so and that is it for the yogurt part of the hummus.
I would recommend using the middle eastern yogurt if you can on the hummus because this taste more better then the regular yogurt that you get in HEB.
You can usually find this at HEB but if cant go to your middle eastern store and they would have yogurt and you just want to add about 2 tablespoons to your hummus.
Not only this gives it a great flavor but it also makes the hummus a little liquidly and not as chunky as it would be if it didn't have this.
A lot of people use olive oil in there hummus to make it a lot thinner then what it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out kind chunky.
It's a lot better to get it more puree that way it has a better texture to it.
This yogurt as I said is non fat it also comes in a version that is not non fat that you can pick which ever one you like but it is definitely very good yogurt.
This one right here is my favorite and I think it is whitemountainfoods.
com you can go and order this.
"Now that we've covered walking properly, lets work on focusing on One Point, so we're actually moving up the body as we go."
"One Point, if you could look, the center of mass, is going to be bellybutton, anywhere from 2 to 3 inches down, depending, so right about where this belt is."
"And we will continue on this subject, shortly thereafter."
Now One Point is the principal of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place.
"One way of thinking of it is that, if you have somebody, it's tensile strength."
"And if you have somebody grab onto your arm, they're out to be a living, breathing connection, that, yes they're, it feels very strong, it feels like a fire hose."
A fire hose is almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it.
"It's a living entity, and therefore, One Point is very much the same thing, it is a living entity."
"And you are looking for that constant relaxed, natural power of tensile strength."
"It's not muscular by any means, and it is certainly not structural, but there is, well I shouldn't say that, because there is an aspect of structural to it."
"With correct structure, and correct relaxation, you build on tensile strength."
"Hello, this is JB, I'm with Austin Homebrew Supply in Austin, Texas."
Talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home.
Subsequently it's food grade.
"In other words, there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleums or lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here."
So.
These guys are called food grade pumps.
"They're made by a company called March, and these guys do a great job of moving hot, boiling wort or beer from point A to point B without you having to pick up big kettles full of hot broiling liquid."
So.
Food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing.
"Or wine, or cider, or socky."
You got a lot of different things you can make here.
So.
"One of the things you want to do at the end of, or during the process of either making beer, especially beer making, or even wine, is you need to rack or transfer, we had some strange terminology here, but, racking means to transfer from point A to point B."
"So, especially in beer making a lot of time you're moving hot liquids from one point to another, especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point."
Well it's going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it.
"So, so, that being said, we carry food grade pumps that, the reason they're food grade is, there's a space between where the motor hosing is, the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between, so."
"There's a complete difference between the motor, and where the actual liquid comes through."
Effleurage is a massage stroke that basically just stroking the horse.
"You can do it either with your hands, with your fingers closed and just stroking down the side of the horse, keeping one hand on the horse all the time while you are doing it."
"Or you can have your fingers more open in sort of a combed shape, the stroking down the side of the horse starting at the poll and working all the way back."
"That's actually a fairly safe stroke to use, either form of effleurage, horse's most likely you know almost always enjoy it."
"They don't find it to be too invasive, it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the, unless you are being careless it's a fairly safe stroke to be using."
So again I'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse.
And just petting them.
"It's a nice gentle stroke, it helps them to relax."
"I'm Tim Gipson, and I'm going to talk to you about trouble shooting your refrigerator."
"Now, if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator, first few things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not tripped in your main breaker box."
"Recommended settings are anywhere from about 34 degrees to 38 degrees, depending on really how cold you like to keep some of your products, particularly dairy products."
"Now if water's not coming out, most of these are equipped with a filter, so in this case, this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filter, and it tells you when to replace it."
"On the ice, occasionally, you may just need to come in here, where these are frost free freezers, this can actually warm up, or some of your ice melts together, and the agitating arm can actually get stuck."
So you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally.
"So I'm Tim Gipson, and that's some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator."
"So you want to locate where that is, and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is reset."
"If it is popped, you want to make sure you reset it to the on position."
The next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet.
So that's basically on the power.
"Now, if you still are not, do not have power, you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point, because there could be something internal to the refrigerator."
"Now this particular refrigerator, it has all electronic controls, so it has its own sensors, which really tell you what's going on."
"This particular model, up here, if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough, you might check your temperature controls."
This particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to.
"In tennis, a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized, that you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot."
And the half volley is one of those shots.
He's just going to block it forward as he comes to the net.
So it's just a way of taking a ball.
You're not really doing much with it.
You're just blocking it forward.
"Now, John McEnroe was a master of this shot."
But you have to have it.
"It's very apropos in doubles that you're able to block the ball back, because if they volley it at your feet, you've just got to be able to block it right back."
So what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls.
See how many in a row you can make.
"See how many out of 50 you can make, and as the number of balls in practice improves, your results on the court are also going to improve."
So here's a drill that helps you get the half volley.
"You can use a wall, which is great."
"But, in this case, your practice partner, in this case it will be me, I'll be throwing the ball to Darren."
"So, imagine that you've hit a nice shot, you're coming to the net, or you've hit a nice serve, you're coming to the net, and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet."
"It bounces up, and you've got to just block it forward."
So that's what this drill is.
So Darren is going to demonstrate.
I'm going to throw it by his feet.
"Knots have a long and varied history throughout time, and today I'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones."
"My name is Robert Segundo, and I'm going to teach you how to make a clove hitch."
"I mean, you can hold things with it."
"You can't put a whole lot of tension on it,because it will slip through."
But it's good enough if you're just trying to hold some items down.
Let's do that one more time.
"Let's pull this up...and out, like so."
"Once again, we'll go over, we'll go under, over our standing end."
"And we'll go over like so, back under, and through the loop we've created, and there it is."
There's our clove hitch.
"My name is Robert Segundo, and enjoy tying knots."
"Now a hitch, technically, isn't a knot, but it falls in the same category of kind of the macrame style."
"So what we're going to do is, we're going to look down to our table here, and we can see I have my rod, here, that I'm going to attach my line to."
"What I'm going to do is, I'm going to take my line initially, I'm going to roll it up and over, and then bring it under, like so."
"Then it's going to go over the standing end that was there, and I'm going to take my working end back up and over."
"And it's going to come under, and then back through the loop, like so."
There you go.
"This is basically two half-hitches put together, and this is just a clove hitch."
And it's really tight.
"Hello, have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce? Well, I'm Dr. Felicia and I'd like to share a few tips with you."
"If you have children, you need to prepare, if you're going to have to move and assign them into new schools, get them registered."
You may need to actually enlist family support for child care.
"You may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out, in terms of who keeps what, belongings and personal belongings in the house, who keeps what."
"And if you are the caretaker of the children, you obviously need more than the party who's going to leave without the children."
"In either case, I wish you good luck."
And remember it's how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy.
"Good luck, Dr. Felicia, goodbye."
"Preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect, whether you're the male or the female in the relationship."
"One of the things you want to consider, especially if you're the female is that for instance today, most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation."
"So, if the partner wanted to go back to school and be career-oriented, that's give them three years time in preparation."
"So, that's a pretty frightening prospect in itself."
"If you already had a career and you're in a working world, it's not as quite as frightening, but, chances are your assets are pretty well divided, and you're going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself."
"You want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interest or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive, it's not worth it."
You may wish to downsize and put yourself into a situation where you can readily afford it on one person's pay.
The other thing that you want to prepare for is housing.
Alright we've just completed our two flowers.
They've been clear embossed and then they've been embossed with glassy glaze and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a center for each of these flower.
And just push the chipboard back a little bit if you don't have enough room.
Alright now we're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyelet.
Alright.
And then the little one same thing.
Alright now we want to hang this off the wreath so I'm going to need a smaller hole.
I need a 3/16th so I'm going to just poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there.
And I'm going to be using some natural hemp twine to tie this on to my wreath.
I chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that I've chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see I've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers.
I've attached them with the hemp twine and then I've tied it altogether with the 5/8th wide certainly Sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your Mom will be proud to hang on her front door.
And I'm using the jumbo eyelets in my cropodile and I'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the 3/16th punch.
"Punch it out, and do the same thing with the smaller flower."
Punch that out.
And I'm going to be using the pewter eyelets.
And I'm just going to push down.
And sometimes if you're not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better.
There's one.
And now the second one.
"I'm going to show you how to make a Razberi Sunsplash, a wonderfully fruity cocktail."
We are going to start off with our ice.
"Then, we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine."
"Uno, dos, like so."
"And, about an ounce of orange juice, yum."
And then we're going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice.
"So, this is going to be so wonderfully tropical."
"Hence, the name Sunsplash."
Go ahead and shake it up.
"And if you have a hurricane glass, great."
"If not, you can also serve this in a highball glass."
"Garnish it with a cherry, and there you have it, Razberi Sunsplash."
Just like so.
Cheers.
"Pour that into your glass, and then we're going to add to that, three fourths of an ounce of coconut rum, any brand will do, so choose your favorite."
"You're the one drinking it, and I want you to like it."
We're then going to add three-fourths of an ounce of raspberry liqueur.
Just like so.
That's going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor.
As is our peachtree schnapps.
"Also, three-fourths of an ounce, so equal parts."
"Now another important thing for you to remember, and this is going to be a little difficult, because we all tend to like to please people, we all tend to like accolades and praise."
But it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech.
"Well, the last time I did that speech everybody hated it."
"Or, everybody said I was bad."
"Past failures of people not liking your speech, or not liking you, have nothing to do with present and future presentations."
Maybe that happened before.
"Ok, so what?"
Move on.
It won't happen this time just because it happened last time.
Everyone does not have to love you.
"I found that out many, many years ago as a college professor when I used to try to please all of my students."
"And invariably I would have one, or maybe two, a semester, that just, they just didn't like me."
"It didn't matter what I did, they didn't like me."
And that was ok.
It's ok if one or two people disagree with your speech.
It's ok if one or two or three people don't like you.
You have to continue to allow that to be ok. You also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker.
"A big misconception is that if your dog's tale is waging, is that he's happy."
"So, it's ok for dogs to look and be curious, but if they get that intense obssessive stare, then it's going to be threatened."
"Alot of dogs wag their tales when they are ready to attack as well, so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail is."
"Like if his tail is tucked, then he's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time."
"You never pet a dog when he is afraid, because that will make him more afraid."
"If it is laying loosey like this, this is just normal."
"When he's waging his tail and it's out here in the middle, that means he's happy, that's a normal state of mind."
"When the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this, your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind."
"Another thing about dogs, when you're walking them, you'll see their ears perk up, if their ears perk up, that's them paying more attention."
"But you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and when they are fixating on something, that's when you need to correct them because that's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person, or another dog, or anything like that."
Today we're going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish.
Part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday.
"Simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use, when you should do a water change."
Another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt.
Aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress.
My name is Michael and today we're talking about how to diagnose an ailment.
"When we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn, they're not in rough shape, they're not sitting at the bottom."
"Once you've been keeping your fish for a while, you're going to know if they're acting different."
A common problem with fish is Ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself.
"A lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality, temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves."
One thing that I like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product.
"We have MELAFIX and PEMEFIX. MELAFIX is an anti-bacterial and PEMEFIX is an anti-fungal. What I like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem, we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well."
"If there is clay on here, what happens is, as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot, see if I don't keep cleaning that tool off, all it does is keep going round and round and round."
"Clean it off, you've got a lot of time."
So you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there.
"Sometimes it sticks to your pot, sometimes it doesn't."
"So when you get clay on your tool, any tool for that matter, clean it off, set it aside."
"So you start with a nice clean tool, so that as you take your tool, touch your piece, remember this is still kind of sticky, your clay trimmings don't transfer from your tool back onto your pot."
You're trying to get it off of your pot.
"So we're going to come down in here again, clean some more of that off."
See how you have that all down there?
You have to clean this off.
Sometimes you just get little pieces of clay.
Next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard.
The edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board.
"Typically with the freestyle board it would have complete, wrap around, the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ."
On a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board.
The only other exception to the rule is the Magne-Traction sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice.
If you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns.
And now we're going to go over Fireball.
"But, you've also got to realize that that X divided evenly, rounded down amongst the number of targets."
Fireball is a very long-standing staple of the red series of this game.
"It is X and a red, much like Blaze."
"However, Fireball is a little different."
"Fireball is a Sorcery, but you may pay the X damage and have it deal to a single creature or play."
"However, Fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets."
"So you would divide that damage evenly among the targets, but you also have to pay one additional colorless Mana for each additional target."
"So, if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red, and then you would start counting Mana for the X."
"Likewise with two, three, and so forth."
"Ok. Now let's talk about turning the compost pile. Well, if it's all good, and you put this pile together right, you don't have to turn the compost pile."
But we have plenty in the woods.
You would add your leafy--your garden debris for aeration.
And then you would start to turn your pile.
"You would take the top and you would put it on the bottom, just like this."
"Because, if you layered it right, and you watered it right, and you got your microorganisms in there, and you put the compost inoculate in there, you shouldn't have to turn this pile."
"Now, obviously, this is a brand new pile that we just made today."
"But, if for some reason your pile didn't cook down, which means if your pile is four feet high, when it's finished it should be about a foot and a half high."
"And it should cook down, and it should go down, and you should be able to see that it looks like compost, not like this material."
"But if you come across your pile, and it hasn't done those things, then you're going to want to turn your pile."
The way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning.
We would put holes in the ground so it would drain good.
"We would create--add some more sticks, which we've run out of."
