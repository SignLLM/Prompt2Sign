## Quick Start

**Download the CLI**  
Install the Prompt2Sign CLI using pip (ensure you have it in your Python environment):

```python
pip install prompt2sign-cli
```

Alternatively, follow the repository's guide to download the necessary tools and utilities: [Prompt2Sign CLI Tools](https://github.com/Prompt2Sign/cli-tools-link)

**Choose Your Subset**  
Whether you are interested in for ASL part or GSL part, our CLI makes it easy to specify and download just what you need without having to obtain the entirety of the large datasets.

```bash
prompt2sign --output_directory="~/prompt2sign_data" --datasets ASL_part GSL_part
```

Note: Download failed, please use the following Google hard drive/other network drive.

## Download Data

**Prompt2Sign ASL part for ASLP**

V2 News: Added the [OpenASL](https://github.com/chevalierNoir/OpenASL) dataset, the condensed data set obtained is as follows:

- [Coming soon]()

It can be used in the training of ASL production models. 

**Prompt2Sign GSL part for GSLP**

After preprocessing [Phoenix-14T](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/) dataset, the condensed data set obtained is as follows:

- [https://drive.google.com/file/d/17qiIoJG7KyhfhDz9rOlYF4vDkcr2jmBd/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17qiIoJG7KyhfhDz9rOlYF4vDkcr2jmBd/view?usp=sharing)

It can be used in the training of GSL production models.

## More Processed-Data

This unit includes some useful data sets for sign language preprocessing:

**How2Sign for SignDiff<sup>2</sup>**

After preprocessing [How2Sign](https://how2sign.github.io/) dataset, the condensed data set obtained is as follows:

- [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DHmePcRpc5TJ1XkjOfA8VYKKLGCL8nlJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DHmePcRpc5TJ1XkjOfA8VYKKLGCL8nlJ/view?usp=sharing)

It can be used for the diffusion model training of pose2video in sign language. (Based on [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet/blob/main/docs/train.md))

**How2Sign for Vid2Vid**

After preprocessing [How2Sign](https://how2sign.github.io/) dataset, the condensed data set obtained is as follows:

- [https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/220064](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/220064)

It can be used for the diffusion model training of pose2video in sign language. (Based on [Vid2Vid](https://github.com/NVIDIA/vid2vid))

## Tool for Data

Our pre-processing tools: the data Cleansing tool and the three-step 2Dto3D tool.

## Tool Usage
<!-- This section could provide foundational knowledge or context for the rest of the content -->

Coming Soon, you can take a look at our [project homepage](https://signllm.github.io/), which is actually quite detailed.

## FAQ
<!-- List out FAQs here -->
**Are there dataloaders available for the dataset.**

Two answers: Yes & coming soon. For each of the benchmarks, there is a dataloader available that was used to generate the benchmark results and that should cover most purposes. There's also a set of common dataloaders coming, which will be available sometime in next year.
