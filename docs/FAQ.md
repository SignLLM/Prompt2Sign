**Are there dataloaders available for the dataset.**

Two answers: Yes & coming soon. For each of the benchmarks, there is a dataloader available that was used to generate the benchmark results and that should cover most purposes. There's also a set of common dataloaders coming, which will be available sometime in next year.
